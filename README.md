# GoAnimate Studio
Source code from the Legacy Video Maker of Vyond (original `go_full.swf` file can be accessed [here](https://d3v4eglovri8yt.cloudfront.net/animation/66453a3ba2cc5e1b/go_full.swf)).


*Note:* This has been decompied from [JPEXS Flash Decompiler](https://github.com/jindrapetrik/jpexs-decompiler/releases/tag/version11.2.0), the inner-workings of which I have no knowlegde of.  If you're interested in modifying this repo's code and re-compiling it, I'd recommend using the same program.
